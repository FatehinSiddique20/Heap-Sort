# Heap-Sort
Heap sort vector implementation
Now generate the Driver file (main.cpp) where you perform the following tasks: 14 	33 	27 	10 	35 	19 	48 	44  

Given an unsorted array, do the following: 1)	Now sort this array by using heapsort. 2)	Print the content of the array. 3)	Build a MaxHeap and find the minimum element. Print the minimum element. 4)	Write a separate MinHeap.h file for implementation of a minheap. 5)	Build a MinHeap and find the maximum element. Print the maximum element.
